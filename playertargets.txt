player targets to consider W13:
JHill (obvious)
MMitchell possibly (just some ownership, good CB matchup)
probably fade kelvin benj (sea def getting healthy)
fade ajayi, arob, dez
Hightower strong play if ingram misses
Moncrief if TY injured
Hunter Henry if Tyrell injured
Sammy Watkins
Doug Martin strong spot
Hokins is ok this week
Edelman is ok
Cooks/Thomas (alternate ownership of those)
Own some stafford?
Vance/Kendricks/Ebron all viable TE targets
Consider riddick/hyde
