TODO:

streamline process

data collection / analysis (keep all data leading to lineup generation)

data collection for simulation: std deviations, score -> winnings history

possible data sites to look into:
https://empeopled.com/p/96108 (reddit def)
https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb (nfldb python)
http://www.pro-football-reference.com/
http://rotoguru1.com/cgi-bin/fyday.pl?game=fd

correlation in simulations (would likely favor stacking)
have data that suggest .4 correlation coeff between QB/WR1, could probably just hardcode this for a set of qb/wr pairs and use R lib here:
http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/15011/generate-a-random-variable-with-a-defined-correlation-to-an-existing-variable
http://www.rcpp.org/
Would probably slow down simulation a bit more?
How much value do we get here?

optimizations/code cleanup

backtest process
