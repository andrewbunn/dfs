TODO:

streamline process

data collection / analysis (keep all data leading to lineup generation)

data collection for simulation: std deviations, score -> winnings history

New idea for "lineup pool generator"
For "pool" players, set price == net cost so none are favored over the others (problem with this is other places with better value will be overvalued, but their value has to be really high)
output X lineups, should have lots of combinations of those players, can use that pool for lineup select optimizations

automation TODOs:
ownership - start with MIT fixed low values, some iterative variation of current selector to adjust this with lower lineup count (how does changing ownership % -> overall probability)

more correlation data
more projection data/processing
big issue with projections is noting tweaks throughout the week
